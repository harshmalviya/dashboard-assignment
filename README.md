## **Questions regarding assignment**

**Q1. What was the most challenging part?**
The most challenging part in this application for me was to copy the exact styles given in the figma file withing the time period. Apart from this, integrating chart js library was indeed a challenging part as copying the exact styles given in the designs took a little time. 
  
**Q2. What was the most fun part?**
The most fun part doing the assignment was that I was allowed to use tailwind css, otherwise It would have taken more time to complete. Apart the from this, whole assignment was worth investing time as there was lot to learn and practise. 
  
**Q3. What do you think is wrong with this task or could be made better in this task?**
To be honest I felt this assignment a little lengthy as there were 5 pages to create. Also the functionality part was missing I felt. If there were additional functionalities to implement apart from the one's included then it'd have been more fun.

## Self Evaluation

**Summary:** This assignment was a great learning experience for me as I implemented many things that I've learnt by myself. I like the fact that I was able to complete this assignment withing 5 days in all respect. The way I have used tailwind css to create the exact designs given is the biggest positive of this assignment. Creating components that look exact same like the one's given in the design, with functionalities similar to the one's mentioned are great takeaways from this assignment. This dashboard can be actually used with real life data in production with added features, and nothing better then this can define the statisfaction I have for completing this assignment.

The thing that I could have done better in this assignment is refactoring of code in multiple files for funcitons that are defined and used withing the same components. This is one thing that I'd have improved. I'd liked to add more features and the first one being the full fledged authentication, a backend to support this high performant frontend. Adding form submissions on the settings page is also one thing that I'd loved to work on, on both frontend and backend. 

- I'd rate knowledge of reactjs and javascript as 9 on 10.
- I'd rate knowledge of understanding UI given as 8.5 on 10.
- I'd rate knowledge of usage of external api to create charts as 9 on 10.
